into an OpenShift release for this assembly. The tags will not be
valid unless --apply and is supplied.

Applying the change will cause the OSBS images to be mirrored into the OpenShift release
repositories on quay.

Applying will also directly update the imagestreams relevant to assembly (e.g.
updating 4.9-art-latest for 4.9's stream assembly).

You may provide the namespace and base name for the image streams, or defaults
will be used.

The ORGANIZATION and REPOSITORY options are combined into
ORGANIZATION/REPOSITORY when preparing for mirroring.

Generate files for mirroring from registry-proxy (OSBS storage) to our
quay registry:

\b
    $ doozer --group=openshift-4.2 release:gen-payload \\
        --is-name=4.2-art-latest

Note that if you use -i to include specific images, you should also include
openshift-enterprise-cli to satisfy any need for the 'cli' tag. The cli image
is used automatically as a stand-in for images when an arch does not build
that particular tag.

## Validation ##

Additionally we want to check that the following conditions are true for each
imagestream being updated:

* For all architectures built, RHCOS builds must have matching versions of any
  unshipped RPM they include (per-entry os metadata - the set of RPMs may differ
  between arches, but versions should not).
* Any RPMs present in images (including machine-os-content) from unshipped RPM
  builds included in one of our candidate tags must exactly version-match the
  latest RPM builds in those candidate tags (ONLY; we never flag what we don't
  directly ship.)

These checks (and likely more in the future) should run and any failures should
be listed in brief via a "release.openshift.io/inconsistency" annotation on the
relevant image istag (these are publicly visible; ref. https://bit.ly/37cseC1)
and in more detail in state.yaml. The release-controller, per ART-2195, will
read and propagate/expose this annotation in its display of the release image.
